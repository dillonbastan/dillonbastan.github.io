					<br> This is mostly a reasoning for why I am doing this, this way
					<br> Well my project is not anything new: <b>give up. And spontaneity.</b> Cage talked about it, and many long before him.
					<br> Maybe he didn’t give up enough or we wouldn’t know about him :p
					<br> I will give up trying to figure anything out about this.. give up seeking the new noise, just as one is to give up seeking Buddha nature to realize it
					<a href="images/3.jpg"><img src="images/10.jpg" width = 100 height = 150 style="float: right; margin-right: 20px;"></a>
					<br> New noise perhaps is spontaneous. As mentioned, we maybe cannot even know what it is.
					<br> New noise could be open to all possibilities, can become all possibilities, the full spectrum, just as white noise contains equal intensity at all frequencies
					<br> According to Shaw, microscale activity transmits energy to macroscales, through the mixing power of chaotic attractors, and vice versa through large events dispersing into microscales
					<br> Energy is in dialogue across scales. New noise is speaking to us, and we are speaking to it. Or is that seeing a duality that does not necessarily exist by creating a separation? 
					<br> Duality collapses from the strange attractor
					<a href="images/5.jpg"><img src="images/2.jpg" width = 100 height = 150 style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;"></a>
					<br> We can recognize a rhythm, or many rhythms, that speak to us in the vastness of uncertainty, just as we can all nod at different times to noise music. Or we may quiet ourselves and release our awareness. All seem to me to be wonderful ways to exist
					<br> Is noise a disrupter and liberator when a paradigm is not open to the full spectrum of possibilities? If so, does acceptance dissolve that role of noise?
					<br> Loosely paraphrasing from “White Noise in Eight Amplified Movements” from memory… Noise is nothing at all, it doesn’t exist, it is only what is happening each moment. As soon as we recognize or describe the current state of noise, we are describing it in the past, and it is no longer what is happening
					<a href="images/9.jpg"><img src="images/3.jpg" width = 100 height = 150 style="float: right; margin-right: 20px;"></a>
					<br> Again, perhaps new noise is spontaneous. But also, a dialogue. Maybe I am contradicting myself..
					<br> But for me, I cannot know what my project is, the new noise. I cannot conceive it or ponder about it. To do so would be to limit the possibilities. I have to give up knowing it and just do it (the project) when I am doing it. Just have a dialogue with whatever is happening, and accepting that
					<br> This is also nothing new though
					<br> This project is now my practice of accepting and letting happen. This is me removing separation between noise and everything else through recognizing and accepting. Accepting noise as it is, as it may be introduced, or as an ever unfolding process across scales, as inseparable from from the larger scales
					<a href="images/2.jpg"><img src="images/11.jpg" width = 100 height = 150 style="float: right; margin-right: 20px;"></a>
					<br> This project is a practice of my unification, openness, and coming to understand The Void in my own capacity
					<a href="images/11.jpg"><img src="images/4.jpg" width = 100 height = 150 style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;"></a>
					<br> Yes so now something a bit different but same..
					<br> In the Lankavatara Sutra it is said “Form is not different from emptiness; emptiness is not different from form. Form is precisely emptiness; emptiness is precisely form.”
					<br> So form is void just as it it is, and form is perhaps also that dialogue across scales, even fractal in nature. Forgive me for all the ignorances in this text! This is a process for me, and also a fun playing
					<br> To continue inspiration from Mahāyāna Buddhism, the Dharmadhatu doctrine of the Avatamsaka Sutra describes that “the perception that each single form, just as it is, is the void and that, further, the uniqueness of each form arises from the fact that it exists in relation to every other form”
					<br> Duality collapses from relativity
					<a href="images/8.jpg"><img src="images/5.jpg" width = 100 height = 150 style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;"></a>
					<br> Perception of the dialogue as it is (the form), and in doing so dissolving duality, maybe is The Void. 
					<br> To some in the Zen tradition this can be realized through living spontaneously 
					<br> Lao-tzu said the essence of Tao is spontaneity
					<br> Rumi said emptiness contains what we need, because lovers/workers are always seeking a void to fill
					<a href="images/10.jpg"><img src="images/7.jpg" width = 100 height = 150 style="float: right; margin-right: 20px;"></a>
					<br> Ok now even another different thing…
					<br> Running far away with a limited Chaos Theory understanding: to recognize randomness, or noise, as noise is to not recognize the origin, to not see what connects everything to together.
					<br> Through recognizing the nature of noise, or noise as it is — or the state.. or even structure of a system as it is — rather than noise as noise: boundaries disappear, complicated rules dissolve and we all have a good laugh or cry
					<br> The vast possibilities of noise gives us the vocabulary we need to speak our existence… Something that we can never really comprehend, but maybe intuitively glimpse on some level when we give up and give in to total immersion in spontaneous expression. That is noise.. for me and my current project at least, that is “The (new) Noise”
					<br> Because talking about my project only brings it further from “The (new) Noise”, the rest of my project proposal will be, as best as I can achieve, spontaneous expression, as a more sincere description of my project.
